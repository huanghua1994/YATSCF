# YATSCF: Yet Another Tiny SCF

My final project for CSE 8803 Spring 2018, a HF-SCF program:

*   Written in C;
*   Parallelized with OpenMP in single node ("Tiny");
*   Used [Simint](https://github.com/simint-chem/simint-generator) for ERIs.

In short, this program can be viewed as a tiny, more "formula translation" version of [GTFock](https://github.com/gtfock-chem/gtfock).
