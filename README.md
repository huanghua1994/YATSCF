# YATSCF: Yet Another Tiny SCF

My final project for CSE 8803 Spring 2018, a HF-SCF program:

* Written in C99, parallelized with OpenMP in single node ("Tiny");
* Used [Simint](https://github.com/simint-chem/simint-generator) for ERIs;
* Used SAD initial guess and DIIS(Pulay mixing) to accelerate SCF convergence.

In short, this program can be viewed as a tiny, more "formula translation" version of [GTFock](https://github.com/gtfock-chem/gtfock).
